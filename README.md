This plugin extends Apple's Dictionary Application with a German-English dictionary.

The content of this plugin is based on the online dictionary [www.beolingus.de](https://www.beolingus.de) by TU Chemnitz.

The Python script to convert the BeoLingus dictionary into a dictionary plugin was developed by Wolfgang Kreutz.

### Uninstalling

You can also manually delete the plugin from the folder `/Library/Dictionaries` or `~/Library/Dictionaries` and restart the Dictionary.app.

### Build the dictionary by yourself using the source code

#### Requirements

- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
-¬†[Dictionary Development Kit as part of Additional Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=Additional%20Tools) (free Developer Account necessary)
- The DDK must be installed at the following Paths:
  - `/Developer/Auxiliary Tools/Dictionary Development Kit`
  - `/Developer/Utilities/Dictionary Development Kit`
  - `/Applications/Auxiliary Tools/Dictionary Development Kit`
  - `/Applications/Additional Tools/Utilities/Dictionary Development Kit`
  - `/DevTools/Utilities/Dictionary Development Kit`
  - `/Applications/Utilities/Dictionary Development Kit`
- Install the Xcode Command Line Tools with: `
¬†xcode-select --install`
- *Optional:* To generate the Installer, you have to install the free tool [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html)
-¬†*Optional:* To generate the Disk Image, you need [DMG Canvas](https://www.araelium.com/dmgcanvas) (20 US-$).

#### Start building with Terminal

- open Terminal.app
- Use `cd` to go into the folder `beolingus-deutsch-englisch-master`.
- Start building with `make. This will download the current word list from tu-chemnitz.de, converts it to XML, and uses the DDK to build the Dictionary plugin. The version number is generated by using the current date with the suffix **-beta**.
- The conversion takes several hours.
- If the Terminal returns to the prompt, you can install the plugin with `sudo make install`. This is also necessary when you want to create the Installer. It expects the plugin at /Library/Dictionaries.
- After installation, the Dictionary App will be opened automatically, so you can activate and test it.
- The make command accepts the following additional targets:
  - `make release`builds the plugin without the suffix ‚Äú-beta‚Äù in the version number.
  - `make dmg`creates an Installer from the already installed **Beta**-plugin and generates a Disk Image (note the requirements). The Makefile uses my developer certificate, which you have to replace in the line with `packagesbuild`. The finished Disk Images is put into the folder `releases`.
  - `make releasedmg`creates an Installer from the installed plugin without the beta-suffix and generates a Disk Image (note the requirements). The Makefile uses my developer certificate, which you have to replace in the line with `packagesbuild`. The finished Disk Images is put into the folder `releases`.
  - `make notarize`sends the Disk Image from the current date folder inside `releases`to Apple for notarization. Here you also have to edit the Makefile and enter your developer account at `xcrun altool`behind `--username`. The password is fetched from the Keychain entry `AC_PASSWORD`.
  - `make nhistory`shows the notarization status. In most cases, it's better to wait for the confirmation Mail from Apple.¬†
  - After successful notarization, `make nstaple`applies the ticket to the Disk Image. Correctly notarized, it's ready for publishing.
